Some of my hobbies include: disc golf, cheering for the Minnesota Vikings, mentoring a FIRST robotics team and trying new craft beers.

Programming Background
Before starting at OSU I had no programming experience.

Since starting at OSU, my favorite assignment was the creature fighting game from 162.
